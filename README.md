# â–£ WALLIT

WALLIT is a decentralized wallet that utilizes Lit Protocol to create infinite private keys, removing the need for users to manage and store their own private keys. Lit Protocol uses a unique technology called Lit PKP (Private Key Protection) to securely store and manage private keys.

### What is Lit PKP?

Lit PKP is a technology developed by Lit Protocol to securely manage private keys in a decentralized manner. With Lit PKP, private keys are divided into fragments, encrypted, and stored across multiple nodes in the Lit Protocol network. This ensures that private keys are never fully accessible in any single location, making them much more secure than traditional private key management solutions.

### Features

* Infinite addresses: Users can create an unlimited number of addresses without worrying about managing their private keys.
* Fast transactions: Transactions are processed quickly and securely on the Lit Protocol network.
* User-friendly interface: The wallet has an intuitive and easy-to-use interface that makes it accessible to all users.
* Decentralized: The wallet is fully decentralized, ensuring that users have full control over their funds.

### Architecture and Technologies

WALLIT is built using the following technologies:

* Lit Protocol: Used to create infinite private keys and process transactions securely and quickly.
* Lit PKP: A technology developed by Lit Protocol for secure private key management.
